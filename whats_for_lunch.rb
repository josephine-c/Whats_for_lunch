# Create a new file called whats_for_lunch.rb
# Open that file
# Create the following 2 lines of code in the file:
# Declare a cost variable equal to 40
# Declare a tasty variable equal to true
# I will NEVER eat a meal if it costs 50 or more. I will eat a meal, regardless of taste, if it costs 30 or less. I will also eat a meal if it costs more than 30 and is tasty.
# Write an if/elsif/else statement for the above conditions
# In terminal use ruby to run the file â€¦ ruby whats_for_lunch.rb
# Try altering the value of price, and changing tasty from true to false, and see what happens!
# Expert:
# * Change the above if/elsif/else to just an if/else
# Super-duper-expert:
# * Change it to a one line ternary operator

#********************Code version 1 (if/elsif/else statement)*********************************************
